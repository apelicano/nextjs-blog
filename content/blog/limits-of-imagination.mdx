summary: "Flying cars with tailfins. Smartwatches that look like old watches. Why do our future ideas always seem to borrow so much from the past?"

My daughter and I were talking about how people used to imagine the future — flying cars, robot servants, moon colonies — and she casually brought up “retrofuturism.” That hit the nail on the head.

It’s this thing where the future ends up looking like the present, just with chrome and blinking lights. Flying cars that still look like 1950s sedans. Spacesuits with shoulder pads. Computers that still have knobs.

Why does this happen? Why can’t we seem to imagine a truly different future?

Here’s what I think is going on.

## Skeuomorphism: When the new copies the old

Remember when smartphones had "slide to unlock"? That was skeuomorphism — copying the look and feel of physical objects in digital interfaces. iBooks had pages that "turned" and leather-bound covers. Calculator apps still look like real calculators.

It’s basically a user training trick. New tech wears old clothes so people don’t feel lost.

But it also limits how far we’re willing to reimagine things. Instead of asking, “What’s the best way to unlock a screen?” we go, “Let’s make it feel like a lock.”

## Retrofuturism: The future as imagined from the past

Retrofuturism is full of examples where people took the cutting-edge tech of their time and just… added rockets.

1950s: Let’s make cars fly.  
1980s: Let’s put CRT monitors on spaceships.  
Even sci-fi books did this — Martian colonies with typewriters and filing cabinets.

It’s a creative limitation. When we try to imagine the future, we often just take today’s stuff and add a few tweaks.

## Path dependence: The inertia of habits

Certain things get locked in, even if they’re no longer optimal.

QWERTY keyboards, car layouts, front grilles on electric vehicles — all these choices made sense *at the time*, but we keep dragging them forward because change is expensive, risky, or just unfamiliar.

Even when the underlying tech is radically different, the form factor stays the same because it’s what people are used to.

## Design fixation: Getting stuck on what already exists

This one’s a psychological thing. Once you see a certain solution to a problem, it becomes hard to imagine others.

If you give a designer a brief to make a “smartwatch,” 90% of them will design a round or square thing that goes on your wrist — even if a totally different form might work better.

The same goes for tech products, interfaces, even city planning. We’re not as inventive as we think. Most of us just remix what we already know.

## Real innovation is rare — and weird

Most creativity is recombinative. We mash things together: phones + watches, cars + drones, books + screens.

But once in a while, someone skips the remix and comes up with something *genuinely new*. It feels off at first. Sometimes even stupid. But later we realize it was ahead of its time.

Those ideas don’t always come from experts. Sometimes they come from people with no baggage — or no reason to care about the rules.

## Want to see this in action?

Here’s a quick test: Try to imagine a brand-new kind of communication tool.

Now remove:
- screens
- phones
- words
- touch
- apps
- computers

Tough, right? That mental stall you feel? That’s the box we think we’re outside of — but usually aren’t.

---

## So why does the future keep borrowing from the past?

Because we’re human. We like patterns. We like things that feel familiar. We get uncomfortable when the future looks too unfamiliar.

But recognizing that tendency is the first step to breaking it.

Next time you’re building something — a UI, a product, even a habit — ask yourself: am I doing this because it makes sense, or because it *looks* like something that made sense in the past?

The future doesn’t need tailfins.

## Curious what you see?

What’s a retrofuture thing you’ve always found weird or hilarious? Or something in your daily life that still looks and behaves like a much older version of itself?

I’d love to know. Or better yet, show it to a kid. Their reaction might tell you more than any article ever could.

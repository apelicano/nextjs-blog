title: "From Crowd Work to Code: Why I’m Trying to Switch Careers After 15 Years"
author: Rafael del Espejo
summary: After 15 years in government research, I’ve decided to shift to web development. This isn’t a success story — it’s a work in progress, and that’s okay.

### A message I sent to a friend last year:

> “I’m going to try finishing a full web dev curriculum in the next 3–7 months. Very ambitious, I know. But this career shift is needed and wanted. My eldest is going to college in two years, and I’ve felt stagnant for the past 15 years in my government research job. That part’s on me.”

That message didn’t mark a triumphant pivot. It marked the start of a long, uncertain process — one that I’m still figuring out. Some days, I feel like I’m getting somewhere. Other days, I wonder if I’ve taken on more than I can handle.

But I haven’t quit. That counts for something.

## It Started With Crowd-Sourced Work

Like a lot of people trying to supplement their income, I started out doing crowd work: bug testing, subtitling, virtual assistance, surveys — whatever I could try in between day job hours.

It looked promising at first — flexible hours, global clients, no need to interview.

But a few months in, I had more sign-ups and onboarding certs than actual payouts.

They weren’t outright scams. Just dead-end systems optimized for extraction, not growth. High competition, vague instructions, no real ladder to climb. I wasn’t building anything. I wasn’t learning anything. And I certainly wasn’t earning enough to justify the time I was putting in.

## Reframing the Question

Eventually, a different question bubbled up:

> Why settle for testing someone else’s app when I could learn how to build my own?

That question stuck. It wasn’t just about income anymore — it was about direction.

## Finding Tools That Work for My Brain

I went through a bunch of online paths to learn web dev. Some were too rigid. Some were too chaotic. Some just didn’t match how my brain processes long-term tasks — especially with what I now suspect is undiagnosed ADHD.

What helped more was a combination:
- **freeCodeCamp**, for structure without pressure
- **YouTube**, to see how others build real things
- And selective deep dives like **Full Stack Open**, even if I didn’t finish everything

I wasn’t chasing certificates. I was chasing comprehension — and eventually, it started to click.

## Why It Matters

This shift isn’t just about tech skills or job titles.

It’s about trying to reclaim momentum — for my family, and for myself.

My eldest will be in college soon. My middle child is neurodivergent and thriving in ways I want to support more directly. I’ve got debts and long-term decisions to clean up. And frankly, I’ve coasted too long in roles that didn’t stretch me.

This isn’t about chasing passion. It’s about rebuilding agency.

## The Grifter Problem

Along the way, I ran into the usual traps — quick-win listicles, “top 10 websites that pay in dollars,” and endless recycled content that promises passive income with zero expertise.

It’s easy to mistake struggle for personal failure when everyone online looks like they’ve figured it out already.

But I’ve started to tell the difference between people who teach and people who extract. I’m learning to filter the noise.

That’s part of why I’m blogging — not to posture, but to document what’s useful and real.

## What This Blog Is

This space is where I’ll keep track of:
- Projects I’m building (even the messy ones)
- What I’m learning about dev work, focus, and staying motivated
- Honest notes on switching careers in your 40s with a family depending on you
- And the occasional ADHD white rabbit that pops up — because chasing them is part of how I work, too

I’m not here to teach. I’m here to reflect — and maybe help someone else feel less stuck in the process.

## One Last Thing

Back in high school, I used to solder circuit boards while blasting music through cheap headphones. That was my flow state — learning, tinkering, losing track of time.

This blog is my attempt to find that state again.

Not because I’ve “made it.” But because I’m still trying. Still showing up.

And maybe that’s enough to start with.

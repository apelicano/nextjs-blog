If you’ve worked in disaster risk reduction, geospatial planning, or exposure mapping in the Philippines, you’ve probably run into this frustrating situation:

- **DHSUD** talks about “lifelines,”  
- **NHA** uses “critical infrastructure,”  
- **LGUs** log their own categories like “barangay facilities” or “evacuation centers,”  
- And the **DRRM office** might treat *all* of them as “critical facilities.”

And you wonder:

> “Why isn’t there just one standardized set of terms? Isn’t this stuff supposed to be harmonized by now?”

Short answer: **because harmonization is hard — and no one wants to give up their vocabulary.**

## The Problem with Terminology


Every agency builds its own system — with its own definitions, spreadsheets, and database structure.

Then they expect others to integrate — without adapting anything. Now multiply that by all the national agencies and thousands of LGUs. You end up with a mess of mismatched terms and incompatible systems — especially when trying to build a shared **exposure database**.

---

## How Harmonization *Should* Work

### 1. Build a Mapping Table First

Step one is to figure out what terms actually mean the same thing — and map them. You don’t need to force renaming; just agree on **semantic equivalence**.


Example mapping table:
```txt
| LGU Term               | DHSUD Term   | NHA Term               | Harmonized Term             |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Barangay Health Center | Lifeline     | Critical Facility      | Health Facility (Tier 1)    |
| Basketball Court       | Public Asset | Community Structure    | Non-Critical Facility       |
| Water District Office  | Lifeline     | Critical Infrastructure| Water Utility Office        |
```

No need to make LGUs change how they encode data. You just translate it during processing.

### 2. Use Shared Vocabularies (Even If They're External)

You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. There are existing vocabularies that work:

- [UNDRR Terminology](https://www.undrr.org/terminology)
- [ISO 22300 Series](https://www.iso.org/standard/50296.html) (security and resilience)
- INSPIRE/Sendai Framework schemas

Some of the more flexible systems don’t even rely on fixed field names — they use tagging, schema registries, or RDF/JSON-LD.

For example, under the hood, a database record might look like:

```json
{
  "asset_name": "Barangay Health Center",
  "asset_type": "facility",
  "function_tags": ["health", "lifeline", "critical"]
}
```

### 3. Maintain and Publish a Shared Schema


Someone needs to own and publish the working version of the harmonized schema:

+* Store it on GitHub, GovCloud, or wherever it’s accessible
+* Version control it
+* Link to docs and sample implementations

Agencies can keep their own terms internally, as long as there’s a translation layer. The schema just needs to flag or resolve mismatches — and evolve when edge cases come up.

---

### 4. Back It Up with Policy (and Actual Incentives)


You can’t fix this with tech alone. Agencies won’t harmonize unless:

* There’s an agreed baseline set of terms
* DILG or OCD pushes official guidance
* LGUs have something to gain — access to funding, tools, or national platforms

Compliance should be linked to access. If you want to use the shared DRRM tools, align your vocabulary.

---

## Why This Usually Breaks Down


* Agencies guard their own vocabularies because it reflects their mandates.
* Legacy databases are expensive and risky to change.
* No one owns or maintains the vocabulary list full-time.
* LGUs are just trying to get the system to accept their data without errors.

---

## What Can Be Done?

Here’s what a realistic path forward might look like:

1. Agree on a shared vocabulary table across agencies.
2. Allow mappings instead of renaming fields.
3. Version and document the schema publicly.
4. Set up inter-agency groups with actual authority to approve changes.
5. Use tagging or classification systems, not fixed field names.

## Final Thoughts

If the goal is a real national DRR platform, the foundation isn’t just maps or dashboards — it’s **shared vocabularies**.

We need fewer silos, open schemas, and an honest effort to coordinate — even when it means compromising on familiar terms.


If the legend doesn’t make sense, neither will the map. Agreeing on terminology is the first step toward making systems work together.

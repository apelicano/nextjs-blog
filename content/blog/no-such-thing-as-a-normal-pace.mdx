It wasn’t lunch. I’d already eaten.

But I took a lunch break anyway—an hour and a half outside the office, away from the pile of deadlines I’ve been dodging for days. I didn’t go to a coffee shop. I didn’t decompress like I planned. I ended up doing a school supply run—for my 9-year-old daughter, who needs a Formal Theme booklet this week, though she’s not exactly sure when.

So I walked.

I walked from the office to a nearby mall, passing through a university campus I know well. Turns out the walk takes about 30 minutes. Maybe more if you’re normal. I don’t have a normal pace. I never did.

When I’m well rested, I can’t lounge. I speed-walk by default, like I’m late for something even if I’m not. And when I’m tired? I still walk like a disgruntled walkathon participant who’s got something to prove to no one in particular. My pace is either overclocked or fueled by spite. There is no neutral gear.

As I passed through the campus, I caught the tail end of some graduation ceremony. Students hugging parents. Parents letting go. That bittersweet ceremonial pause before one life chapter ends and another one kicks in without warning.

I’m not in a ceremonial pause. I’m in a grind. A slow unraveling and reknitting of responsibilities—parenting, full-time work, executive dysfunction, and the constant war between intention and action. The deadlines I missed this week weren’t tragic. They were just familiar. Chronic. Personal.

But here’s the thing I’m trying to hold onto:

I left the office because I was overwhelmed.
I walked not to escape—but to reroute.
I didn’t finish everything. I bought a booklet.

And somehow, that was enough.

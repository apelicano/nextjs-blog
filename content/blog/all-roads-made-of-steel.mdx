title: What If All Roads Were Made of Steel?

Let’s say you’re born into a world where asphalt, gravel, and concrete are rare or non-existent — and steel is cheap, abundant, and everywhere.

Naturally, every road, alley, bridge, and driveway ends up made of metal. Not just slabs of steel, but smart structures — internally reinforced, maybe with bridge-style cable systems that adjust to stress in real time.

What would that world actually feel like to live in?

## Heat and Temperature: Steel + Sun = Regret

Steel conducts heat way better than anything we use for roads today. So in a tropical summer, surface temps would soar past 70°C. Step on it barefoot? Good luck. Even tires might start behaving unpredictably — sticking or slipping depending on surface temp.

In colder areas, same story in reverse: steel loses heat quickly, so it’d be icy and treacherous. Frost, black ice, and a total lack of grip. Not fun.

And then there’s thermal expansion — steel expands ~1.2 mm per meter per 100°C. On a kilometer-long road, that’s nearly 5 cm of stretch during a big temperature swing. Expansion joints could handle some of it, but you’d probably hear the roads shifting, creaking, and clunking throughout the day.

## Driving: Not Great Without Help

Steel isn’t great for traction. Rubber tires need rough surfaces to grip. Smooth metal? Slippery when dry, worse when wet.

Unless these roads are deeply textured, or vehicles switch to mag-lev systems or rail-like treads, you’re looking at a serious decline in braking performance and handling. Accidents in this world would happen fast and often.

Unless the roads are smart — think embedded nano-textures that change dynamically, or some kind of temperature-sensitive surface coating — it’s just not going to be safe.

## Maintenance: Not Easier, Just Different

Some upsides here: steel, if protected, can last longer than asphalt. If your road network has internal stress-distribution systems, it could adapt to heavy loads better too — like mini bridges beneath every highway.

That also opens up possibilities: embedded sensors, vehicle counters, temperature tracking, even wireless power delivery for EVs. You could build a real smart-road system if the infrastructure could handle it.

But maintenance becomes a whole new job. No more potholes, sure. Instead, you're fighting rust, replacing corroded joints, recalibrating sensors, and keeping a tight eye on fatigue fractures.

## Electromagnetic and Environmental Weirdness

Make all the roads steel and the whole planet becomes a conductive grid. You’re now dealing with:

- More frequent lightning strikes, especially in storm-prone areas
- EM interference with nearby communication systems
- Noise — and not just a little. Picture millions of tires skimming across steel at speed. That high-pitched screech would be background noise everywhere

There’s potential here too: you could harvest solar heat, or electrify the road network for smart transit — but the system would need to be incredibly well-designed, because…

## Grounding: The Invisible Risk

This is where things get tricky. People assume that metal roads touching the ground are automatically grounded. They’re not.

To handle lightning, fault currents, or induced voltage, you need real grounding — engineered, deliberate, and distributed.

Without proper grounding:

- Lightning strikes could arc into buildings or vehicles
- Embedded systems — charging coils, sensors, communications gear — could get fried
- People walking nearby could get zapped if they touch anything metal during a storm

Proper grounding means:

1. Driving rods deep into conductive subsoil every 50–100 meters
2. Bonding all metal segments so there are no floating voltages
3. Installing surge arresters everywhere electronics live
4. Designing drainage carefully so water doesn’t become the conductor

Without it? You’ve got a massive hazard disguised as infrastructure.

## Engineering the Roads Themselves

If every road acts like a bridge, then you get to do some cool things:

- Modular steel tiles with tension cables underneath
- Dynamic flexing under traffic
- Self-monitoring, self-reporting structures
- Even roads that adjust to terrain — floods, landslides, heavy loads

But all of that means more complexity, more failure modes, and more systems that need power, protection, and — again — proper grounding.

## So… Would It Work?

A steel-road world wouldn’t be completely unworkable. You’d just be trading familiar problems (potholes, cracking, asphalt fumes) for a new batch:

- High surface temps and thermal instability
- Slippery surfaces and traction challenges
- Massive EM complexity and grounding headaches
- Maintenance that's more like running a bridge network

Still, it’s not a bad mental model for sci-fi infrastructure. If you want a planet that feels advanced but still kinda broken — or a near-future city that looks cool but isn’t exactly safe — steel roads would do the trick.

Just make sure the civil engineers have backup. And maybe hand out some earplugs.

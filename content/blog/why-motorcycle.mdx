## Quick answer

"Motor" was used long before electric motors. In terms like *motorcycle* or *motor vehicle*, it just meant something that moves under its own power — engine, steam, or otherwise.

## A short history of the word "motor"

The root is Latin — *movēre*, "to move." By the 1600s, "motor" could refer to anything that caused motion, even metaphorically (e.g., "he was the motor behind the revolution"). 

Later, the term was applied to steam engines and combustion engines. It didn’t matter *how* it moved — just that it moved without external force.

## What made it a "motor vehicle"?

By the late 1800s, there was a need to distinguish vehicles that didn't require horses.

So we got:
- motor car
- motor carriage
- eventually, motor vehicle

The defining trait wasn’t the engine type — it was that you didn’t need reins.

## Why a "motorcycle"?

Same deal. Early motorcycles were bicycles with small combustion engines. If you didn’t need to pedal, it was a motorized cycle. Hence, *motorcycle*. The term stuck even though most still run on gas, not electricity.

## When did electric motors enter the picture?

Electric motors showed up around the 1800s. But by that time, “motor” already had traction in common language. Later, engineering narrowed the term to refer to electric-to-mechanical devices — but in everyday language, the older meaning persisted.

## So what’s the difference between engine and motor?

There's a soft distinction:

| Term       | Typical Use                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Engine     | Internal combustion (e.g. cars, bikes)  |
| Motor      | Electric drive (e.g. Teslas, fans)      |

But it’s not strict. A rocket engine isn’t a piston engine. A Tesla has no engine. And a motorcycle still gets called a *motor*-cycle even when it uses a combustion engine.

## Is this like conventional current?

Yes, same energy. Conventional current assumes flow from positive to negative — a definition that predates the discovery of electrons. It’s technically inaccurate, but stuck.

“Motor” followed a similar path. It was coined before electric motors were mainstream, and by the time the tech evolved, the name had already fossilized.

## Final thoughts

"Motor" in motorcycle doesn’t mean “electric.” It just means self-powered. It's a leftover from an earlier stage of tech — like QWERTY, "dialing" a phone, or “hanging up” after a call.

Not wrong. Just legacy.

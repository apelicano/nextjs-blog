I didn’t mean to choose a pseudonym with baggage.  
But I’ve never been good at clean slates.

There’s something about the name **Rafael del Espejo** that felt… inevitable. Like it had been waiting behind the mirror all along, tapping softly until I looked up from the noise and finally saw it. Not clearly. Just enough.

## **A Name That Doesn’t Flinch**

**Rafael** means *"God has healed."*  
I’m not religious, but I understand the hunger for meaning. The idea that maybe healing isn’t a finish line, but a process. A slow stitching. Maybe even a bit of scar worship. I’ll take it.

**del Espejo** means *"of the mirror."*  
Not in it. *Of* it. Like the name belongs to someone who didn’t just see their reflection — they came from it. Fragmented, yes. Warped, maybe. But real.

It’s a name that implies witness. Not heroism. Not grandeur. Just… presence.  
And sometimes, that’s the hardest thing.

## **Memory is a Trick Mirror**

I remembered “May Day’s Eve” by Nick Joaquin mid-scroll, mid-meltdown, mid-another-why-am-I-like-this moment. A street. A night watchman. *“¡Guardia sereno-o-o! Alas doce han dado-o-o!”* — the call marking midnight, ritual crossing over into myth.

That story — a girl before a mirror, a boy before his own idea of manhood — hit differently this time. Not as a high school lit assignment, but as a quiet thesis on how memory lies. How we twist our ghosts into whatever shape lets us sleep at night.

I’ve lived with that tension.  
Still do.  
So I write.

## **Why a Mirror? Why Now?**

Mirrors in stories are never just mirrors. They’re **portals**.  
To old selves. Possible futures. Regrets we rehearse like bedtime prayers.

I’m not here to write polished conclusions. I’m here to **catch distortion in motion** — to track how my thoughts shift under stress, fatigue, wonder, shame. Writing isn’t performance for me. It’s surveillance. Of the self.

There’s a kind of soft alchemy in that.  
Not the Instagram-filter kind — the kind where you turn mess into meaning. Quietly. Without needing applause.

## **What the Name Holds**

> **Rafael del Espejo** = "He who heals through reflection"

That’s the fiction. That’s the spell I’m casting.

And maybe it’s not true.  
Maybe I’m just a guy who walked too far for a school notebook and started monologuing into a blog.  
Maybe I’m just trying to build something permanent out of moments I’d otherwise forget.

But maybe — just maybe — writing is the only way I know how to look into the mirror and not flinch.

So if I write under a name that isn’t quite mine,  
it’s not to hide.  
It’s to remember who I’m becoming.

## Until Then…

The watchman keeps calling.

I’m still listening.
